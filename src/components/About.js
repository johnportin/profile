      <p>
        Hello, I am John Portin. I believe that we should use our skills,
        intellect, and privilege to help others. That's why I want to turn my
        passion for programming and mathematics into a career that will allow me
        to make a positive impact on the world. As a student at the University
        of Kansas since 2016 I received my MA in 2016, and will receive in the
        summer of 2023. Throughout my time at KU, I have taken numerous computer
        science courses and completed several programming projects. I really
        enjoy building things that people can use in their everyday lives. I
        believe that my combined expertise in mathematics and computer science
        will allow me to make significant in any industry I choose to work in.
